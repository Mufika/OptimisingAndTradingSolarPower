# Optimising And Trading Solar Power

Work-in-progress notebooks for optimizing and trading solar power.

## Getting started

- Create/activate a Python environment (this repo does **not** commit local environments).
- Open the notebooks in JupyterLab/VS Code.

## Repo notes

- Local environments are ignored via `.gitignore` (e.g. `env/`, `.venv/`).
